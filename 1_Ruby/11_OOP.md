# Object Oriented Programming

## Objects

Throughout the Ruby community you'll often hear the phrase, "In Ruby, everything is an object!". We've avoided this reality so far because objects are a more advanced topic and it's necessary to get a handle on basic Ruby syntax before you start thinking about objects.

```ruby
irb :001 > "hello".class
=> String
irb :002 > "world".class
=> String
```
